Yesterday the artist who has created most of Wyrmsun's graphics, [Jinn](http://jinndevil.tumblr.com/), finished with an update that is being prepared for the Faction Flair Packs: they're soon going to include command panels interface graphics of their own. Here's a preview of the new Frankish interface:

Jinn is currently also working on the Teuton temple, which is coming along nicely. The structure's model is finished, as you can see below:

The next step will be to work on the rendered model pixel by pixel, to produce the 2D graphics used by the game.

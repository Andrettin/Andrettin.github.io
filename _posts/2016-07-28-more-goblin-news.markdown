Goblin development is now nearly complete. Their sword icons, user interface and transport ships have been finished by [Jinn](http://jinndevil.tumblr.com/), so that now only their "stand ground" and shield icons are left for them to be implemented in the game as a playable civilization.

Soon you will be able to play as goblin custom heroes and factions!

Continuing the improvement of the Grand Strategy mode, characters now have expanded functionality. Any character of a warrior unit type can now be used for battle, and new such warriors are generated from time to time. Additionally, characters can now occupy ministerial positions within your faction (if it is a polity), granting you bonuses.

Provinces can now have modifiers, which provide benefits (they appear in the left part of the main province interface). The "Build a Library?" event, for instance, now adds a Library modifier to the province, boosting research.
